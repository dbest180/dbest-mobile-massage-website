                                    <p>Most clients undress completely, but you should undress only to your level of comfort. You will be properly draped with sheets and blankets at all times. Some clients prefer to keep underwear on, which is perfectly fine.</p>
                                    <p><strong>For sports massage:</strong> Athletic wear may be appropriate. We'll discuss this during your consultation.</p>

                                <div class="faq-answer">
                                    <p>It's recommended but not required. A quick shower helps relax muscles and removes lotions or oils that might interfere with massage oils. However, if you're coming straight from work or exercise, we completely understand!</p>

                                    <p>It's best to avoid heavy meals 1-2 hours before your session. A light snack is fine. Being overly full or hungry can be distracting during your massage.</p>
